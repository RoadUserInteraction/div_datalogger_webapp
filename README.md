# Web interface for the DIV Data logger

This repository contains all the web-pages designed for visualizing and recording the data from the logger developed on ROS (http://www.ros.org) and installed on a Raspberry Pi 3. The web interface uses roslibjs and the ROS package called rosbridge. It is possible to visualize the lidar data and the IMU data in "real-time". It is possible to start and stop recording the data from all the sensors into a rosbag file.
